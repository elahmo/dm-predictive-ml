\begin{abstract}
Prediction of box-office revenue during the pre-production period is a challenging task. Previous works have faced this problem as a classification task and most of them focus on the post-release scenario only. In this paper, we aim to predict the box-office revenue in a pre-production stage, which is more difficult because the number of features available is very limited. The most important contribution of this work is a platform built on top of sklearn GridSearch, which allows to assess a host of pre-processing, transformation, reduction, and machine learning algorithms in a single pipeline. We used this platform to cope with the task of predicting post-office revenue in a pre-production stage.
